This repository provides a self-contained implementation of the Fourier-based approximate quantum probability image encoding (FAQPIE) method introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06471. The FAQPIE is an amplitude-encoding type method for preparing quantum states whose amplitudes encode pixel values of images. This method allows for the efficient circuit construction of image encoding by means of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).
